‚öΩ Football Player Tracking with YOLOv8s

In this project, I developed an application that tracks football players in match videos using tracking algorithms and assigns unique IDs to each player.
This was accomplished using the YOLOv8s model for real-time object detection, followed by object tracking to ensure that each player's movements are accurately followed throughout the video.

Project Features:

Real-time Detection: The application detects football players in each frame of the video using the YOLOv8s model.

Player Tracking: By leveraging tracking algorithms, each detected player is assigned a unique ID, ensuring consistent tracking across frames.

Customizable: The application can be modified to track other types of objects and tailored for different video scenarios.
